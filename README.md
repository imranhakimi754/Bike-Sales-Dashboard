# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

**Project Objective:**

The dataset was meticulously cleaned by identifying and rectifying errors, addressing missing values through thoughtful filling or removal of incomplete rows, and ensuring consistency by standardizing formats for dates, text, and numerical values.
Key data points were carefully selected for visualization, followed by the creation of insightful charts, including bar, line, and pie charts. A PivotTable was constructed to efficiently summarize the data, and dynamic slicers and filters were integrated to enhance interactivity, allowing for deeper exploration.
The dashboard layout and design were refined for clarity and professionalism, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This provided an intuitive and accessible experience, making the insights easy to interpret and actionable for the viewer.
